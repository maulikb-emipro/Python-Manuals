It’s so nice to have you back where you belong

One of our old favorite songs from way back when

You’re still goin’ strong

You’re lookin’ swell, Dolly

Have a little faith in me, fellas

While the band’s playin’

I feel the room swayin’

Promise, you’ll never go away

Dolly’ll never go away again

Dolly, never go away again

Hello, Dolly

You’re still glowin’, you’re still crowin’

So, take her wrap, fellas

So, golly, gee, fellas

I can tell, Dolly
